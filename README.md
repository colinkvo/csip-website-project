# csip-website-project
Custom Website Built for the CCM CSIP Program

This is my first "large" project.
I was in a class called The Internet and Web Page Design at the County College of Morris, New Jersey.

This was my final project for the class, which I wrote almost entirely from scratch.

The overall look and feel of the HTML was something I designed also while in the class, but was a smaller set of homework assignments that built to an entire webpage.

I decieded to go ahead of the homework, and go beyond the textbook's design plan, where I added smooth curves and edges, shadows to text boxes for a "pop out" effect, and experimented with dynamic image headers, which I thought would look good for my final project.

The project is mostly about "Our Class" or the dual enrollment program I was in with 18 other students.
Though I didn't write about all of them, I had some examples of how our class was more of a family than just a room full of smart students.

I orginally didn't have a Git, nor did I plan to make one until college, but a good mentor of mine told me to create one and add all my work to it, even if it was just HTML and CSS.

So here I am — Colin Vo, 17 years old — I can't wait for what the future holds, and hopefully I can look back at this repository, remember that I wrote this long README, and smile as I reflect upon how much I've grown and accomplished since I wrote this file.
