				<p class="containerText">
                    For the 2019 CSIP Student Workshops, interested sophomores and their parents
					were invited to come to Emeriti Hall, home of CCM's Cybersecurity Center, to
					participate in activities to learn about what we do and why it is essential to
					the cybersecurity field.

                            Guests were taught how to cut, strip, order, and crimp RJ-45 wires
                            in a lab activity. They then were guided in testing their connections
                            with Raspberry Pis, where they were able to communicate with one another through
                            a direct connection.

                            In this activity, guests were instructed to take apart computers in a lab activity. 
                            They learned what the internal pieces of a computer looked like, what they were
                            called, and what they did. Then, they were challenged to put the computers back
                            together, and test to see if they worked.

                            however, one person was blindfolded, and the other was to guide them
                            only using simple movement commands. Although it seemed easy, any
                            errors would cause the group to "rerun" their code and start again.

                                how to program it? One of the first classes CSIP students take is 
                                Computer Science I, which is based around the Java programming language. 
                                Guests were guided in building the code for a classic rock, paper, scissors
                                game, using common methods used within the Computer Science I course.
