					What Classes Do We Take?

                    Along with our normal high school classes at our different districts,
                    we take three classes in the fall semester, one class over the winter, 
                    and three classes in the spring semester.

                                In Intro to IT, we were taught the basics of IT, from BIOS/UEFI
                                to the internals of a hard drive. We took apart and put back together
                                computers in the lab, and we were even able to fix some that were 
                                broken. Intro to IT was a very hands-on class and taught us how to
                                properly handle a computer.

                                Operating Systems was much more than learning about the surface of Windows.
                                In OS, we were taught about Windows, MacOS, Linux, and Unix. With hands-on 
                                labs using a virtual machine, we learned about command line, OS functions, 
                                and much more.

                                In Computer Science I, or what we called "Java", we learned the basics of 
                                the programming language Java, hence the nickname. We learned how to use 
                                basic Java packages and libraries, such as java.util, java.lang, and javax.swing.
                                By writing programs for calculators, games, and much more, we were able to write 
                                a Java program of our own by the end of the semester.

                                In Foundations of Info Security, or "Security" for short, we learned 
                                about methods of cyber attacks, encryption methods, and much more on 
                                the basics of cybersecurity. We learned to identify a type of attack,
                                and leanred how to use ans efficient method to counter it.

                                Visual Basic, also known as VB or VB.net, uses Microsoft's Visual Studio
                                and a drag-and-drop API to develop applications for Windows. We learned 
                                how to make basic Windows applications as well as web applications, and 
                                got an introduction to graphical design when it came to user interfaces.

                                Web Design is focused around, well, designing webpages. We learned how to 
                                use HTML and CSS, as well as things we should keep in mind when making a website. 
                                This project is actually from this class, and the skills we learned from it are

                                and then you suddenly understand why your internet is so bad...
